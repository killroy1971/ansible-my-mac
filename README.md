#My MacBook (or OSX) setup playbook
Note: Currently turning into an Ansible role

This contains the following:
* initial_mac_setup.sh -- Installs homebrew, then ansible
* homebrew-packages.yml -- Installs or updates packages, including casks

On OSX, the ansible.cfg file is located in your home diretctory: ~/.ansible.cfg, and 
the ansible directory is also located in your home directory: ~/ansible/.
